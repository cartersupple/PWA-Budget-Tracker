# Budget Tracker Starter Code

## Description 
Say you are a medical professional working in West Africa for a Doctors Without Borders program. You need to keep track of spending on medical supplies when you are out in remote areas lacking cell service. Or, you just have T-Mobile in the Marina District of San Francisco and need to keep track of how much you just spent at Starbucks without internet access. This PWA Budget Tracker uses a NoSQL database to store deposits and withdrawls by a user. Entries are saved when the user is out of range of internet access and uploads the deposits or withdrawals once the user has reestablished an internet connection.
